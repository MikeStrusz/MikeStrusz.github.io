								<p>I enrolled in Coding Temple’s Data Analysis program as a math teacher with 17 years of experience, aiming to leverage my math and ideation skills to make a real-world impact. I chose this program for its robust curriculum, ensuring I was overprepared for a mid-career switch. A few months in, I was recruited as a Data Analyst Intern at Tip a ScRxipt, a local Milwaukee startup, where I performed data modeling for prospective customers and investors using SQL, R, Python, and Tableau.</p>
								<p>In this bootcamp, I learned advanced Excel, SQL, R, Python, machine learning, and Tableau. I’ve analyzed diverse datasets, including customer surveys, A/B marketing analytics, government logistics, retail, scientific research, and price modeling. For my capstone, I built a machine learning model trained on my music tastes to predict which of the 60+ albums released weekly I’m most likely to enjoy. I’m passionate about using machine learning for forecasting and customer segmentation to predict behaviors, such as identifying customers unlikely to follow up on appointments or those most likely to convert to season ticket holders.</p>
								<p>Just as I built 10 of the 18 classes I taught from scratch, I bring a diverse knowledge base and deep curiosity to data analytics. I’m eager to join a Milwaukee-area or remote organization where I can apply my skills to push products and ideas further than imagined. I’ve also used AI to amplify the skills I learned at Coding Temple and am passionate about harnessing its power to make a difference in people’s lives.</p>

								<p>Driven by a passion for transforming data into actionable insights, I’m currently advancing my skills through a data analytics bootcamp at Coding Temple. With over 15 years of experience as a high school math teacher, I’ve honed my analytical skills and deepened my understanding of data. As I transition into data analytics, I’m eager to apply my expertise and enthusiasm to new challenges and opportunities.</p>
								<p>Currently, I’m a Data Analyst Intern at Tip a ScRxipt, contributing to data visualization and product development feedback while applying my analytical skills to fintech challenges. My internship concludes by October 31 or upon securing a full-time position. I’m excited to bring my skills to new opportunities starting in early November.</p>
								<p>Outside of analytics, I’m passionate about indie music and run a side project ranking the top 100 albums of the year. I also volunteer at local artistic venues, enjoying the vibrancy of live performances.</p>
